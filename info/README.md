## Description
REAL BAKU 2015 was developed for [FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights](www.fidh.org), to raise awareness of arbitrary detentions in Azerbaijan leading up to the 1st European Games, essentially Europe&#8217;s version of the Olympics. It was created in collaboration with [Agence Babel](http://agencebabel.com/) in Paris, France. REAL BAKU 2015 was written in JavaScript/HTML5 using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game framework. Sounds were created in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) the opening jingle was created in [Bosca Ceoil](http://distractionware.com/blog/2013/08/bosca-ceoil/).
